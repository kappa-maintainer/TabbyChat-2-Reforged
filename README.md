TabbyChat 2 also has an API. Check the `mnm.mods.tabbychat.api` package for the source references.

# Installing
**Requires LiteLoader**

If you wish to use forge on 1.10.x, the minimum version supported is build 2020. A bug was fixed in that version which was causing a crash with mixins (See [#57](../../issues/57)).
